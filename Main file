# Iris classification using Naive Bayes classifier

## This data set consists of 3 different types of irises' (Setosa, Versicolour and Virginica) petal and sepal length stored in 150x4 np array.

## The rows being the samples and the columns being : Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.

# Loading dataset

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
iris = load_iris()

# Assigning training and target data

X = iris.data
y = iris.target

X

# Train and test split 

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train,X_test, y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y, test_size=0.4, random_state=101 )

# Training model

from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
gnb = GaussianNB()
gnb.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Making prediction 

y_pred = gnb.predict(X_test)

print(y_pred)

# Comparing accuracy of model

from sklearn import metrics
print("Gaussian Naive Bayes model accuracy (in %):", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred)*100)
